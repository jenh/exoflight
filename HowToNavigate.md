# Inter-Planet #

First, get into orbit. Get into the influence of the planet your target body is orbiting (e.g. to go to Mars, exit Earth's influence and orbit the Sun). You may want to turn your guidance system off (GUID - DRIFT) and press "F" repeatedly to speed things up.

Now go to the Tactical View (F4), select the body you wish to intercept, and press "T" to target.

Select the INTERCP page of the MEDS panel. This performs a search of possible trajectories bounded by MAXTOD (Max Time of Departure), MAXTOF (Max Time of Flight) and MINALT (Minimum Altitude). For inter-planet trajectories, MAXTOD and MAXTOF are typically measured in years.

When you have entered all the parameters, press the Compute button. The search will take several seconds. When complete, you'll see a value in the Min-dV, Time of Departure, etc fields. If you like what you see, press Activate to start the intercept program. The Event Time field will start counting down. Press "F" repeatedly to speed up time to the time of departure.

On some vehicles, the burn will occur automatically. On others you will have to switch to manual throttle and do the burn yourself. Fire until the dV-REM field gets near zero, or until your attitude starts thrashing around.

Now you should be approaching the target planet. You may smack it squarely, or have to point your ship backwards and thrust until you get into orbit around the body.
