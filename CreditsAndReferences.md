## 3D Models ##

Darren "Guttyr" Baker spent many hours pounding out cool-as-heck A-4, Jupiter C, Juno 1, SRB, Gemini/Titan 2 and Saturn V models (among others).

Mark Piatowski contributed very nice and detailed S1B and CSM models, plus textures for Jupiter C.

Hubble and LM models were unashamedly ripped from Celestia, an open-source planetarium (http://www.shatters.net/celestia/)
