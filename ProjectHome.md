A historically-based and future-looking spaceflight simulator. The player can fly several space vehicles and rockets, travel to the bodies of the solar system, and complete a variety of missions.

Features:

  * Fly several spacecraft from history and the future, including the Apollo spacecraft, Saturn V, and Space Shuttle.

  * Breathtaking 3D views of the solar system. Planets and moons are accurately modeled, including terrain and atmosphere.

  * Realistic orbital mechanics and spacecraft guidance. Exoflight Sequencer Language allows complex missions to be carried out on automatic control.

  * Open architecture -- add new spacecraft, modules, instrument panels, planets, and more from fellow users.

You need [Java Runtime Environment 1.6](http://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp) to run this program.

To install, download the file in the "Featured" section for your platform and either run the installer (Windows) or decompress and run the application (OS X). Additional files may be downloaded the first time you run the program.

NOTE: Documentation is spotty (limited now to the [wiki](http://code.google.com/p/exoflight/w/list) and the README) so please be aware of this when trying out the software. Also only the Gemini Missions work right now.
