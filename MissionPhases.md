launch

the launch phase is one of the most critical phases of flight.  accelerating a vehicle into earth orbit requires a tremendous amount of energy that must be expended in a matter of minutes.  punching through the dense earth atmosphere at supersonic speed also subjects the vehicle to extreme heat and stress, and the trajectory must be carefully controlled or the fragile vehicle will overstress and break apart.  space vehicles must be built to very tight tolerances to both minimize weight and to be tough enough to survive a launch.

because of the critical nature of the launch, all functions of the launch are typically controlled by computer.  only a failure in the guidance system would require the pilot to take manual control of the vehicle.  this has never happened in practice, but astronauts still train for this possibility.

the exact details of the launch phase varies from vehicle to vehicle, but the basics of an earth launch go like this: first, the vehicle must get above the earth's dense atmosphere.  it must get above as quickly as possible to conserve fuel, but not go so quickly that the air pressure overstresses the vehicle.  during this phase, the computer attempts to steer the "pointy end into the wind", to reduce stress on the vehicle.  this causes the rocket to begin a slow turn to the horizontal direction, which is called a "gravity turn".

after the rocket has travelled high enough above the atmosphere that it can safely maneuver, it begins the next phase of the launch.  this phase is aimed at steering the vehicle so that it is in the correct orbit at burnout.  this involves steering into the correct plane of the orbit, to the correct altitude, and to the correct velocity at burnout.

you may have heard of "launch windows" during space shuttle launches.  this is a specified interval of time in which the vehicle can launch to the desired orbit.  during a space station intercept mission, for instance, it is critical that the vehicle be in the same plane as the space station so that interception requires as little fuel as possible.  this means that the vehicle must start in close to the same plane when it leaves the ground.

because the earth rotates, the launch site passes through a given plane exactly twice a day -- once when the target vehicle is going north, and once when it is going south.  the reason the shuttle may only launch once a day is that the second launch opportunity requires a launch to the west, instead of east over the atlantic ocean.  the residents of florida and texas might not appreciate solid rocket boosters dropping down over their towns.

intercept

let's assume that this is an intercept mission, and the intercepting vehicle has just launched into a circular orbit at the same altitude and in the same plane of the target vehicle.  the goal is to intercept the vehicle.  how do two vehicles going around and around a planet at thousands of miles per hour meet up?  it's sort of tricky.

the first phase of an intercept is called "phasing".  the idea of phasing is to put the intercept vehicle into a similar orbit as the target vehicle, but one that is slightly larger or smaller than the target.  remember that a larger orbit takes longer to complete than a smaller orbit.  so if the intercept vehicle is in a smaller orbit than the target, it will complete a full circuit faster than the target, and thus with every orbit will be a little closer to the target.

when the two vehicles are sufficiently close together -- "in phase" -- they can begin the next stage, rendezvous.  Now the computer measures the positions and velocities of the two vehicles, and computes a "transfer orbit" to the target.  The computer picks the orbit such that after a given amount of time, the intercept vehicle will cross the target vehicle's path.  The intercept vehicle then performs a burn to get into the transfer orbit.

The final thing that the intercept vehicle must do is slow down to match the speed of the target vehicle.  This is done by periodically computing a new transfer orbit that approaches the target at a lower rate of speed.  This is repeated until the two velocities match within a given threshold.  At this point the final docking phase can begin.

docking

Docking is not as computationally complex as the intercept, but it is still a tricky proposition.  You are attempting to bring together two multi-ton vehicles and link them together without damaging either one.  This requires a bit of fine maneuvering.  It can be handled by computer, but most pilots have traditionally opted to manually steer during the final phases of docking.

The idea behind docking is simple: point the vehicle so that the two docking ports line up, then slowly bring the two vehicles until they touch.  Since the course corrections are very delicate, the rcs thrusters are usually used to perform these maneuvers.
